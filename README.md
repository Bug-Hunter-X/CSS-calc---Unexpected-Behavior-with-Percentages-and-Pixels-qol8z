# CSS `calc()` Unexpected Behavior with Percentages and Pixels

This repository demonstrates an issue with the CSS `calc()` function when combining percentages and pixel values.  The expected behavior is that the element's width should be 50% of its containing element's width, minus 10 pixels. However, the actual behavior may vary across browsers and may not accurately reflect the intended calculation.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code. The `bugSolution.css` file offers a potential workaround or alternative solution if one exists.  This could involve using different units, restructuring the layout, or employing JavaScript for more complex calculations.  Further investigation may be needed to determine the root cause and best solution depending on the specific context.
